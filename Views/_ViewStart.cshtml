        _ViewStart.cshtml
        -----------------
        This file runs BEFORE every Razor view in this folder (and subfolders),
        and sets the default layout file to use.

        By setting Layout = "_Layout", all views will automatically use:
            Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml

        If you ever want a view to use a different layout, you can override
        it in that specific view by setting:
            @{ Layout = "_AdminLayout"; }
        or:
            @{ Layout = null; }   // for a completely layout-less page
    */

    Layout = "_Layout";
}
